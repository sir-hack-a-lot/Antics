**URL to MP3**

* place it's url in a .txt file (newline per entry)
* supply an output dir
* Voil√†: the music will be converted to .mp3 with the title correctly set
This makes use of two projects: soundcloud-download(https://github.com/flyingrub/scdl) and youtube download(https://youtube-dl.org/).
