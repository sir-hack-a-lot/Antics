**URL to MP3**
If you've got a song from Soundcloud or Youtube, 
* place it in a line-separated .txt file 
* supply an output dir
* Voil√†: the music will be converted to .mp3 with the title correctly set
This makes use of two projects: soundcloud-download(https://github.com/flyingrub/scdl) and youtube download(https://youtube-dl.org/).
